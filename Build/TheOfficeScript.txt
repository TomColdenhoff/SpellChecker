Morning, Pam. Did you catch the ‘L Word’
last night?
PAM No. I missed it.
MICHAEL
It was a great episode. Tim found out
that Jenny was cheating on him with Marina, and Dana and Lara broke up. But the whole thing was totally unbelievable.
PAM
Why?
MICHAEL
Because. There’s no way that lesbians
are that hot in real life. I know that we all have our fantasies about a pair of hot lesbian chicks making out with each other, but that’s just not how it is in the real world.
PAM Um, o-kay.
MICHAEL
I mean, seriously, Pam. There’s no way
in a million years that a smoking hot lesbian babe would come up to you and ask you out on a date. It just wouldn’t happen. I mean, I’m sure you must be very attractive to plenty of lesbians out there, but let’s face facts: they don’t look like Jennifer Beals, they look like Rosie O’Donnell.
